# Positivity DashBoard
Positivity Dashboard is a website where users can store their personal accomplishments and achievements
to reflect on later to combat imposter syndrome. Current functionality includes adding positive entries, and storing them. Features to be added in the future:
- A secure login where users can go back and look at their accomplishments
- Improvements in the current UI
